This code loads a pre-trained Inception V3 model, defines a function to read and preprocess an image, downsizes the image to make it easier to work with, and defines a function to calculate the loss for a given image and model. It also defines some utility functions to deprocess and display an image. Finally, it creates a feature extraction model using the specified layers of the loaded model.
